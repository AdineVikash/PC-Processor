# Types of Processors
## Arm based and x64 based Processor's
## 1.Arm based Processor's
ARM Processor are Mobile and Developement board based Processor, those won't be used on New Pc, ARM processors only offer these basic instructions. Thus, a reduced instruction set  ARM processors use less power than x86/x64 processors at the same clock speed.Usually ARM Processor used on Mobiles and Development board rather than Pc
Companies such as Qualcomm, Mediatek use ARM architecture, these chips are mostly made for mobile phones but are also used in single board computers such as a Raspberry pi and ARM-based laptops such as a pinebook pro. ARM only makes the design for the processors, and don't manufature any. Instead it licenses these rights to other companies such as Samsung,Qualcomm, Mediatek etc who then use this design to make custom processors based on the ARM architecture.

## 2.x86 And 64 based Processors
x64 stands for 64-bit processor architecture, which is found in most modern computers. They can handle more amount of ram as compared to x86 processors
Also known as `AMD 64` as AMD made this architecture first.

x86 stands for 32Bit Processors, which is only found in old computers. They can only handle mostly up to 4 gb of ram. There are some exceptions for x86 processors with PAE capability which allows it to handle up to 64 gb of ram. Also known as `Intel x86` as Intel made this architecture first.
Intel and AMD are the major manufacturers for x86 and x64 processors.

## 3.Compatibility
x86-64 Has More Software Support in the P.C Market and can handle ARM Apps Via Emulation but this puts most of these processors at high load.
There were some x86-64 based mobile phones that lasted not too long such as Senwa's LS9718
These are the reason why x86-64 are mostly used in P.C and ARM is mostly used in mobile platform

# Operating Systems:
##x86-64:
Windows, Linux and MacOS are the major operating systems for x86 and x64 processors. Though Android can run on the x86 platform, it is not ideal for everyday use and also has some campatibilty issues with ARM apps for Android.

## ARM:
Linux and Android are the major operating systems for ARM devices. Since both of them are free and open-source, they can be compiled for almost any processor architecture


## 4.Battery Life
x86-64 processor is Battery drainer,that can be used on laptop but Intel and AMD Used Low power Processor on Laptop and High Power on Pc and x86_64 Uses minimum of 5watt , But the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ is Flagship ARM Processor for Mobile and that Processor just use 5 Watt



### I will do Edit's on Future,inorder to add more about Processor's , Thanks :D
