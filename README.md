# Types of Processors on PC 
## Arm based and x64 based Processor's
## Arm based Processor's
ARM Processor are Mobile and Developement board based Processor, those won't be used on New Pc, ARM processors only offer these basic instructions. Thus, a reduced instruction set  ARM processors use less power than x86/x64 processors at the same clock speed.Usually ARM Processor used on Mobiles and Development board rather than Pc
Qualcomm snapdragon,Mediatek uses ARM architecture both are Only Made for Mobile , but Qualcomm snapdragon have there own ARM Processor's for ARM Laptops
## x86-64 based Processors
x64 is shorthand for 64-bit processor architecture.and x86 shorthand for 32Bit Processors,Intel and AMD are Big processor making company on x86-64, But Intel failes on ARM architecture
## compatibility
x86-64 Has More Software Support and that can able to handle ARM Apps Via Emulation, But the issue is Heat and power consumption
x86-64 can't be Assembled on Mobile Mother Board, the proper reason x86-64 uses More Power and Produces more heat ,so processor making company Like Qualcomm ,Mediatek are started using ARM for Mobile Processors
## Battery Life
As i have said x86-64 processor is Battery drainer, and minimum of  5watt for x86-64, But the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ is High end Mobile chip but just 5 Watt
