# Types of Processors
## Arm based and x64 based Processor's
## 1.Arm based Processor's
ARM Processor are Mobile and Developement board based Processor, those won't be used on New Pc, ARM processors only offer these basic instructions. Thus, a reduced instruction set  ARM processors use less power than x86/x64 processors at the same clock speed.Usually ARM Processor used on Mobiles and Development board rather than Pc
Qualcomm snapdragon,Mediatek uses ARM architecture both are Only Made for Mobile , but Qualcomm snapdragon have there own ARM Processor's for ARM Laptops
## 2.x86_64 based Processors
x64 is 64-bit processor architecture
x86 is for 32Bit Processors
Intel and AMD are Big processor making company on x86-64, But Intel failes on ARM architecture
## 3.Compatibility
x86-64 Has More Software Support and that can able to handle ARM Apps Via Emulation, But the issue is Heat and power consumption
x86-64 can't be Assembled on Mobile Mother Board, the proper reason x86-64 uses More Power and Produces more heat 
so processor making company Like Qualcomm ,Mediatek are started Building ARM Processor for Mobile 
## 4.Battery Life
x86-64 processor is Battery drainer,that can be used on laptop but Intel and AMD Used Low power Processor on Laptop and High Power on Pc and x86_64 Uses minimum of 5watt , But the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 is Flagship ARM Processor for Mobile and that Processor just use 5 Watt and has support for the rolling out 5G
## 5.Windows support on ARM

Apple INC Has realesed a new set of ARM proccesers in the 'apple silicon' range To compete with mostly x86 based intel and amd proccessers.
